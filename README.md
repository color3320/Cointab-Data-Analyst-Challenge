# Cointab Data Analyst - Challenge

## Business Scenario
You are a data analyst and your client has a large ecommerce company in India (let’s call it X).<br>
X gets a thousand orders via their website on a daily basis and they have to deliver them as fast<br>
as they can. For delivering the goods ordered by the customers, X has tied up with multiple<br>
courier companies in India as delivery partners who charge them some amount per delivery.<br>
The charges are dependent upon two factors:
* Weight of the product
* Distance between the warehouse (pickup location) and customer’s delivery address (destination location)
On an average, the delivery charges are Rs. 100 per shipment. So if X ships 1,00,000 orders<br>
per month, they have to pay approximately Rs. 1 crore to the courier companies on a monthly basis as charges.<br>
As the amount that X has to pay to the courier companies is very high, they want to verify if the<br>
charges levied by their Delivery partners per Order are correct.<br>
